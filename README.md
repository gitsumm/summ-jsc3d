==========

This is a port of the google code library jsc3d found here https://code.google.com/p/jsc3d/

Gitsumm implementing a normal map and then later porting the entire library to C++ with the goal of using Emscripten to export a similar workflow but now with some low level JavaScript and the ablity to code in both C++ and C# for HTML5 Canvas. Plans are to support both WebGl and mobile phone canvas features.

This is a rough explination, expect this to change soon.
